.TH TP-LINT 1 "February 2026" "tp-lint 1.5.2" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
tp-lint \- Translation Project linter and statistics tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tp-lint
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fILANG\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tp-lint
is a comprehensive tool for analyzing translation status against the
GNU Translation Project (TP) matrix. It downloads and examines PO files
from the official TP repository, providing detailed statistics, coverage
reports, and quality analysis for translation teams and coordinators.

The tool can generate various types of reports including translation
completion statistics, translator activity summaries, package-specific
analysis, and comprehensive status reports in multiple formats. It
integrates with l10n-lint for quality checking of downloaded files.

The GNU Translation Project coordinates translations of GNU software
into many languages. This tool helps teams track progress, identify
gaps, and maintain translation quality across the entire project.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display comprehensive help message with all available options, usage
examples, and detailed descriptions, then exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Show version number, build information, and feature availability, then exit.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-list
List all available languages in the GNU Translation Project matrix.
Shows language codes, full language names, and basic statistics including
total packages and completion percentages.
.TP
.BR \-s " " [\fILANG\fR] ", " \-\-stats " " [\fILANG\fR]
Show comprehensive translation statistics. If a language code is provided,
shows detailed statistics for that specific language including package
coverage, completion percentages, and translator activity. Without a
language argument, shows global TP statistics.
.TP
.BR \-d " " \fIPACKAGE\fR ", " \-\-domain " " \fIPACKAGE\fR
Filter analysis to show statistics for a specific package/domain only.
Useful for focusing on particular software packages or when working
with package maintainers. Can be combined with language filters.
.TP
.BR \-n " " \fIN\fR ", " \-\-top " " \fIN\fR
Number of items to display in top/bottom ranking lists (default: 15).
This affects the length of lists showing most/least translated packages,
most active translators, and similar rankings in reports and statistics.
.TP
.BR \-r " " [\fILANG\fR] ", " \-\-report " " [\fILANG\fR]
Generate a comprehensive translation status report. If a language is
specified, creates a detailed report for that language including
completion status, missing translations, translator activity, and
recommendations. Without a language, generates a global TP overview.
.TP
.BR \-\-report\-format " " \fIFORMAT\fR
Format for generated reports: markdown (default) or html. Markdown
format is suitable for documentation systems and GitHub, while HTML
format provides rich interactive reports suitable for web viewing.
.TP
.BR \-\-report\-output " " \fIFILE\fR
Save the generated report to the specified file instead of writing
to stdout. The file extension should match the report format for
proper handling by viewers and browsers.
.TP
.BR \-j ", " \-\-json
Format all output as JSON for programmatic consumption and integration
with automation scripts. This is a shorthand equivalent to
\-\-format json and affects all types of output.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Suppress non-essential output including progress indicators, informational
messages, and verbose statistics. Only display final results, summaries,
and error messages.
.TP
.BR \-f " " \fIFORMAT\fR ", " \-\-format " " \fIFORMAT\fR
Output format for results: text (default), json, or github. Text format
provides human-readable output, JSON enables programmatic processing,
and github format produces output suitable for GitHub Actions annotations.
.TP
.BR \-\-strict
Treat all warnings as errors and exit with non-zero status code when
issues are detected. Useful for automated quality gates and CI pipelines
where any translation problems should cause build failures.
.TP
.BR \-k ", " \-\-keep
Keep downloaded PO files and temporary directories after processing
instead of cleaning them up automatically. Useful for debugging,
manual inspection, or when planning to run multiple analyses.
.TP
.BR \-o " " \fIDIR\fR ", " \-\-output " " \fIDIR\fR
Output directory for downloaded PO files and analysis results. When
specified, automatically implies \-\-keep. Creates the directory structure
if it doesn't exist. Files are organized by language and package.
.TP
.BR \-p " " \fIPKG\fR ", " \-\-package " " \fIPKG\fR
Limit analysis to specific package(s) only. This option can be repeated
to specify multiple packages. Useful for focused analysis or when
working with particular software projects. Significantly reduces
download time and processing requirements.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-lint
Skip l10n-lint quality checks on downloaded PO files. Only perform
statistical analysis and report generation. Useful when only coverage
information is needed or when lint checking is handled separately.
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-by\-translator
Group and organize results by translator instead of by package or
language. Shows translator activity, contribution statistics, and
helps identify active community members. Particularly useful for
translation team coordination.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-verbose
Enable detailed progress output including download progress, file
processing status, timing information, TP matrix parsing details,
and other diagnostic information. Useful for debugging, performance
analysis, and understanding tool behavior.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Analysis completed successfully without errors or warnings.
.TP
.B 1
Fatal error occurred such as network connectivity issues, TP matrix
parsing failures, file system errors, or invalid command arguments.
.TP
.B 2
Warnings were encountered during processing when \-\-strict mode is enabled.
Issues found but analysis completed successfully.

.SH GNU TRANSLATION PROJECT
The GNU Translation Project coordinates the translation of GNU software
documentation and messages into many languages. It maintains a central
matrix of translation status and provides infrastructure for translators
to collaborate effectively.

.B tp-lint
connects to the official TP matrix and downloads current PO files
for analysis. The tool respects TP policies and implements appropriate
caching to minimize server load.
